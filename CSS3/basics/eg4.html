            Apple Trade In makes it easy to get credit towards the purchase of your next iPhone. Simply answer a few questions about your device. Based on what you tell us, we’ll provide an estimated trade-in value. If you pay monthly, we’ll apply the value as instant credit to lower the monthly payments of your new iPhone. If you pay in full, we’ll credit your payment method after we receive your trade-in. If it’s not eligible for credit, you can recycle it for free.

After your new iPhone ships, we’lllsend you a free trade-in kit with instructions and a pre-paid shipping label. When we receive your trade-in, we’ll verify its condition and if everything checks out, your trade-in will be complete. If your device doesn’t match the condition you described, you’ll receive an email with next steps. If you paid in full and the value of your device was more than the cost of your new iPhone, you’ll receive an Apple Gift Card by email with the remaining amount.

The online trade-in process generally takes two to three weeks.
